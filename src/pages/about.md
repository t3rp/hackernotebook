# Website

This website is powered by [11ty/Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). 11ty is a [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) written in JavaScript that converts Markdown (and other formats) into the HTML you see here. I followed [this setup guide](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/), modified the CSS from Stephanie's [smol eleventy starter](https://github.com/5t3ph/smol-11ty-starter) template, and hosted the content with [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). GitHub actions and Cloudflare pages handle the page builds. I followed [this Cloudflare pages guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-an-eleventy-site/) to allow Cloudflare to pull and build from my GitHub repository. With this implementation GitHub actions confirms the build status before merging to the production branch.
